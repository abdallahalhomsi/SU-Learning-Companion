# SU Learning Companion (Project Title / Mobile Application Name)

### Description  
SU Learning Companion is a mobile application built specifically for Sabancı University students to simplify their academic organization and study routines.
University students often struggle to manage deadlines, track assignments, and keep up with study sessions across multiple platforms — using a mix of calendars, notes apps, messaging groups, and reminders. This constant switching between tools leads to disorganization, missed deadlines, and reduced study efficiency.

SU Learning Companion solves this by bringing all essential academic tools into one unified platform. The app combines a course dashboard, assignment tracking, study timers, flashcards, and note-taking features — giving students a centralized and structured way to manage their academic life.

### Main Purpose — Problem the App Solves  
Students often rely on multiple apps to manage tasks, deadlines, and study plans, which leads to confusion and missed work.  
This app solves that problem by centralizing all academic tools and providing one organized, simple-to-use system.
